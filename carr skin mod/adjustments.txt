ADJUSTMENTS:
Kero - Carr is remade with Flipnote Studio, and I added myself (Axor the Axolotl) to the credits #lol
FunkinPET (qbocat) - Changed the username from "Boyfriend" to "Carr" in the Desktop, and made Carr outlined
17Bucks - Changed Carr icon, and made Carr outlined (also she dies in Boulevard lol)
Epic mod, bro!... 99 - Changed the commenter from "epicdudebf99" to "epicdudettecarr99"
VS. Impostor - Finale - Changed the health bar to black so it fits Carr lol
VS. Impostor - Greatest Plan - I know Henry sings it, and is also the "bf player", so I had to make sure Carr STILL replaces Boyfriend by replacing the "mom" sprite
your average baldi's basics oneshot mod - Changed Carr's icon to fit the style
What if... (Garn47 One-Shot Mod) - Removed Carr in the "gf" spritesheet. We don't need double wtf
Dead Air (Demo) - Carr will not appear. No point, really.
Silly Billy Psych Port and NO TIME! (Blam_Daylight) - Carr turned around. Yeah.
